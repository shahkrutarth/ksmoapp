					<h4>a) 	General:</h4>
					As a service to our users, the Website/APP may feature message boards, chat rooms/areas, discussion forums, ratings, comments, bulletin board services, news groups (including, without limitation, Usenet and other third party news groups), communities and/or other message or communication facilities and other public/semi-public/private forums (collectively, "Forums") where users with similar interests or similar experiences can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for others to answer. We may also offer online discussions moderated by various experts or other persons.
					<br />Much of the content of the Forums, including without limitation the descriptions for many Forums and the content within a specific message, comment or posting, may be provided by and therefore is the responsibility of the third party creator of the Forum or the person posting in that Forum. OPERATOR has no responsibility for such content and is merely providing access to such content as a service to you.
					<br />BY THEIR VERY NATURE, FORUMS MAY CARRY OFFENSIVE, HARMFUL, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL, OR IN SOME CASES, POSTINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MISLABELED OR ARE OTHERWISE DECEPTIVE. WE EXPECT THAT YOU WILL USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE AND EXERCISE PROPER JUDGMENT WHEN USING DISCUSSION FORUMS.
					<h4>b) 	Your Participation/Contribution Requires Consideration:</h4>
					Any information shared (including personally identifiable information or other personal information) that you reveal in a Forum is by design open to the public (or to a private group within a special Forum) and is not a private, secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any Forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may potentially be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. By submitting communications or content to Forums, you agree that such submission is non-confidential for all purposes.
					<h4>c) 	Confidential Obligations:</h4>
					You agree that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type to a Forum that infringes or violates any rights of any party. Further, you may have entered into an agreement with OPERATOR that requires you to maintain the confidentiality of certain material or information of OPERATOR. It is your obligation to confirm that any post to a Forum you make does not breach any confidentiality obligation you have. Unless a Forum specifically notes that all members of the Forum who are able to view posts are bound by confidentiality obligations, and further notes what types of information may be discussed, you may not post information which OPERATOR has required you to preserve as confidential.
					<h4>d) 	Grant of Rights:</h4>
					To the extent you are the copyright holder of any post or submission by you to a Forum, or the Website/APP in general, and such post or submission does not contain any of the information or material of OPERATOR or other information you are required to preserve as confidential by OPERATOR, then; i) you remain the owner of such post or submission to the extent you were the owner; ii) you automatically grant on behalf of yourself or otherwise represent and warrant that the owner of such content or intellectual property has expressly granted OPERATOR, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, display, and/or otherwise exploit, the post, submission, communication, or content in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum now known or hereafter developed; and iii) you agree, represent, and warrant that OPERATOR may sublicense or assign its rights through multiple tiers of sublicenses or assigns.
					<h4>e) 	No Obligation to Monitor:  </h4>
					OPERATOR does not necessarily control the information delivered to the Forums and has no obligation to monitor the Forums. However, OPERATOR reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or legal governmental request or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, in OPERATOR's sole discretion.
					<h4>f) 	No Obligation to Remove; Right to Act:</h4>
					OPERATOR is not obligated to remove any content from the Website/APP which does not violate any civil or criminal laws and any contributions intended for display on this Website/APP via any means, whether submitted via HTTP (web), SMTP (mail), NNTP (newsreader), or otherwise, are presumed to be contributed by the author/contributor with the intent that OPERATOR shall have an ongoing non-exclusive right to publish the contributed content for an indefinite amount of time, unless the content submitted was made under an agreement with OPERATOR with differing terms. If you do not wish to have something which you submit to be published, do not submit it in the first place.
					<br />
					If OPERATOR discovers communications which allegedly do not conform to any requirements/restrictions of the Website/APP or of OPERATOR, OPERATOR may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of the communication. OPERATOR will have no liability or responsibility for performance or non-performance of such activities. OPERATOR reserves the right to terminate or restrict your access to any or all of the Forums at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever. You acknowledge that some Forums available through the Website/APP are available only through the Website/APP and others are available both through the Website/APP and other sources, such as Usenet, over which OPERATOR has absolutely no control.
					<h4>g) 	No Endorsement: </h4>
					OPERATOR does not endorse, support, represent or guaranty the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted in the Forums or endorse any opinions expressed in the Forums. You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted in the Forums will be at your own risk.

					<p>
						For the avoidance of doubt, OPERATOR does not provide transportation services, and OPERATOR is not a transportation carrier. It is up to the driver to offer transportation services, which may be requested by you through the use of the services of OPERATOR. Any decision by you to accept transportation once you are matched through Website/App with a driver is a decision made by you in your sole discretion. OPERATOR offers information and a method to connect drivers and passengers with each other, but does not and does not intend to provide transportation services or act in any manner as a transportation carrier, and has no responsibility or liability for any transportation services voluntarily provided to any passenger by any driver using the services. You knowingly and freely assume all risk when using the services of OPERATOR.
						OPERATOR attempts to ensure that information that OPERATOR provides and its content (which is separate and distinct from the content of third parties, including but not limited to advertisers, users and other third parties) is accurate and reliable, however, errors sometimes occur. OPERATOR does not make any representation, warranty, or guarantee regarding the accuracy of the material posted or transmitted via the Website/APP or the products and services provided by OPERATOR and advises you independently to verify the accuracy of the information provided. OPERATOR does not buy or sell or represent any buyer or seller of services (such as Uber, Lyft, and the like) on the Website/APP, and disclaims any and all responsibility and liability for all sales or attempted sales on and through the Website/APP.

In addition, OPERATOR may make changes and improvements to the Website/APP at any time.

					<p>
					<h4>a) 	Binding Arbitration; Disputes:</h4>
					You agree that any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the Website/APP, its content, or the products or services of OPERATOR, or to any acts or omissions for which you may contend OPERATOR or its employees, agents, affiliates, officers, or directors are liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy ("Dispute"), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration in San Francisco county, California. Such arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator using expedited procedures under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in force at that time. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules. To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefore. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered only in a state or federal court located in San Francisco county, California, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such court for that purpose. You and OPERATOR agree that the arbitrator shall have limited authority to award damages such that the arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages in excess of those permitted under these Terms and Conditions and in no event more than actual compensatory damages. This Agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement or consolidation of arbitration under this Agreement with arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved.
					<br />
					<strong>THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OPERATOR WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN SAN FRANCISO, CALIFORNIA; THUS, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS AND TO SERVE AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY IN CONNECTION WITH A DISPUTE.

YOU AND OPERATOR RETAIN THE RIGHT TO PURSUE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN COURT AND AGREE TO SUBMIT EXCLUSIVELY TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, FOR THAT PURPOSE.</strong>
					<br /><br />
					You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any Dispute, in the event OPERATOR incurs attorney fees or expenses in connection with the collection of sums owed to us by you under this Agreement, we shall be entitled to recovery of those fees and expenses from you.
					<h4>b)	Severability:</h4>
					If any provision contained in this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions and portions of this agreement, and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so as to have the most similar result that is valid and enforceable under applicable California law.
					<h4>c)	Waiver:</h4>
					The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this agreement shall not affect in any way the first party's right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision in this agreement shall not be taken or held by the other party to be a continuing waiver of that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.
					<h4>d)	Export Control</h4>
					You agree to comply fully with all U.S. and foreign export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the APP nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof is exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations.

					<p>
						If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which COMPANY is participating on a third party's Mobile App (or through some other means or medium), we will collect your information from the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to your activity (e.g., to send your order or deliver a prize).

						A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address and/or geolocation of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. The COMPANY may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the Mobile App or to monitor how our users navigate the Mobile App, and the COMPANY may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.

						<strong>a.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information
						From time to time, COMPANY may use and share with third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable user information to show general demographic and preference information among users of the COMPANY Web sites or the Mobile App.  When you visit or download information from this Mobile App, our web servers may automatically collect Mobile App usage information.
